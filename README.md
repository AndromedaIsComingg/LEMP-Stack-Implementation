# LEMP-Stack-Implementation

##### LEMP is a web stack which comprises of 
- LINUX Operating Ststem
- NGINX Web Server
- MySQL for Database Management
- PHP to Empower Server-side Functionality

It is similar to LAMP Stack with the major difference beineg that the web server in LAMP Stack, APACHE, is being replaced by NGINX.
We will start this implementation by launching a Linux Ubuntu operating system from our AWS EC2 compute service.
